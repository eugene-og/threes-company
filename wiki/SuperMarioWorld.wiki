#summary Gameplay report for Super Mario World.

Super Mario World is a great game, and by and large everybody loves it. I played it a great deal as a child, so it was pretty interesting to come back to the game now. I didn't get all that far due to time limits (I'm near the end of the Vanilla Dome as I type this), but far enough to recall the basic dynamic, find most of the secret levels, and stand on a cliff overlooking Bowser's castle. It took me awhile to get used to the controls (particularly on my emulator), but pretty soon I was in third grade again.

My least favorite part of the game is the infamous "Secret Zone", where the player can get unlimited extra lives and power-ups. It's like shipping the cartridge with a GameShark attached. Fortunately, most of the difficult levels aren't made much easier by doing this.

If we were to emulate one element of this game, it would almost certainly be the graphics, which were cutting-edge when the game was released and still look pretty great now. The game embraces cartoonishness a lot better than many of its predecessors, and gets a convincing and fun experience out of very simple forms. Also, flying is very fun, and generally reflects how much this game moved side-scrollers forward. (Pun accidental.)
